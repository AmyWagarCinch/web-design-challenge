# web-design-challenge

For this homework I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past assignment. Specifically, weather data.
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Landing Page contains an explanation of the project as well as links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


The "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
It uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

The "Data" page displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table is a bootstrap table component. The data came from the .csv file. 

The website has, at the top of every page, a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
Is responsive (using media queries).

Finally, the website is deployed to GitHub pages.
